		<p> In my 2+ years of coding, I have learnt many things. The 3 websites displayed above is what I have learnt recently. I have learnt to use p5.js library. P5.js  is a library which simplifies code into pre-written functions , making work a whole lot easier. ! p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality, where you can draw anything you wish. p5.js uses a canvas for everything. Using this canvas is very easy, all thanks to the p5.js library and their predefined functions. However, youâ€™re not limited to drawing canvas. You can think of your whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML elements like text, input, video, webcam, and sound. Also p5.js has a physics engine, which means you can make great games using this library. I heave learnt coding on a few other platforms such as thunkable which you can publish mobile apps on it. I am using visual studio to code. Thank you for reading. </p>
